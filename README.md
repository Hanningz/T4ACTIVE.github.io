# HII ACTIVE Task 4 [Semantic Meta Model Repository](https://t4active.github.io)

##Welcome to Semantic Meta Model Repository
This repository can be seen as a platform for presenting and sharing multiple data models for IoT device management, such as LWM2M, BLE models as well as other non-standard or proprietary models. Moreover, it helps enterprises (organizations) to manage data models for objects and demonstrate them publicly in more appealing way.

### Features

* Browsing diverse data models in a more interactive way
* Searching models, which is implemented by using List.js (a JavaScript library). For more information see [List.js](http://listjs.com/)
* Downloading XML or JSON files containing the data models for use by management servers (Currently supports _**Chrome**_ and _**Firefox**_)
* Allowing new data models to be contributed by pull requests

### To Contribute

We suggest contributing new data models by using Github pull requests. If you are new to pull requests, please check for more information here: [read more](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X_hKpOGpy-lHmtnomO9aA8OPYzGSnaPdtiviwl7QY4U/edit#slide=id.p3)
